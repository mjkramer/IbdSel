This directory contains IBD neutron capture spectra for delayed energies of 4-12 MeV, consisting predominantly of nGd captures with a small contribution from nC captures. These spectra are used by fit_prep for adjusting the rates of the Li9, fast neutron, and alpha-n backgrounds when the IBD selection's delayed energy lower cut is modified from the nominal 6 MeV.

These spectra were produced by fit_prep/get_ncap_spec.py using the output from running IBD selection on P17B, with a delayed energy cut of 4-12 MeV:
